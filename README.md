# rename_photos
Renames the photo files in a sub-directory to prepend the subdirectory name to the file name.

This is built for the case where the subdirectory is a useful name for the context of the photos inside (like "2020-07 Fourth of July in California") and the filenames in the subdirector are not helpful (like "005.jpg", "006.jpg", etc.).  Running this will give the opportunity to rename the files "2020-07 Fourth of July in California_005.jpg
